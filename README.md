# Local_AI
I am trying to create a local AI which can answer our questions based on the pdf's, ppt's on which it is trained on.
This code is fully created using ChatGPT 3.5.
This project for indulging oneself in AI creativity.
Steps to USE :
  1]Create folder name AI, put main.py, text_extraction.py, text_preprocessing.py and question_answering.py in it.
  2]Create folder name "Folder_path" in AI.
  3]Put all the ppt's and pdf's into the "Folder_path"
  4]Open main.py and put folder path as path of "Folder_path".
  5]Make sure you have all these libraries installed " PyPDF2 pptx nltk transformers torch "
  6]You are ready.
Try asking question like "What is a Operating System?"
